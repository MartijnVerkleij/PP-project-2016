\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
The language designed for this project is called Simple Haskell Language (SHL), with file extension \emph{.shl}.


%------------------------------------------------
\chapter{Summary}
\label{summary}
This chapter will give a summary of the features of SHL. 
\paragraph{Data types} SHL supports two types: integers and booleans. 
\paragraph{Simple expressions and variables} SHL supports denotations for primitive values of types as well as operations for (in)equality for values of types. SHL is strongly typed and all variables are initialised upon declaration. It also supports scoping with variable shadowing. The following expressions are supported:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Parentheses
	\item Assignment
	\item Operation (with ==, !=, <>, \&\&, ||, <=, >=, <, >, +, -, *)
	\item Unary operation (with !, -)
	\item Variable
	\item Integer value
	\item Boolean value
\end{compactitem}
\paragraph{Basic statements} SHL supports the following statements: 
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Block
	\item Declaration
	\item If 
	\item While
	\item Call
	\item Fork 
	\item Join
	\item Print
	\item Expression
\end{compactitem}
\paragraph{Concurrency} SHL supports global variables, fork and join statements to implement concurrency.
\paragraph{Procedures} SHL supports basic procedures with call-by-reference.


%------------------------------------------------
\chapter{Problems \& Solutions}
\label{problems_and_solutions}
This chapter is a short discussion of some of the problems encountered during the project and their solutions.

\section{Changing the Types}
During the process of building the type checker and code generation, which was done in parallel, at certain times a change to the AST or Grammar was required. This resulted in a lot of trying to find every instance which had to be changed, and finding unused code during the final day of the project.

\section{Time}
If only the schedule made at the beginning of every project works out and no unexpected problems arise, this would not be a problem. Reality, unfortunately, has not been that kind. Many unscheduled delays and problems arose to delay the schedule more than expected. The solution for this is working evenings and parts of the night on the final days.


- Something about concurrency

- Something about call-by-reference

- Something about other stuff

\chapter{Detailed Language Description}
\label{detailed_language_description}
This chapter will describe every feature of SHL in detail: providing a basic description; information on the syntax with at least one example; usage information along with restrictions; a description of its effects and execution; and some general information on the generated code.

%\subsection{Feature}
%\subsubsection*{Syntax}
%\subsubsection*{Usage}
%\subsubsection*{Semantics}
%\subsubsection*{Code Generation}


\subsection{Program}
\label{def:program}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{[GLOBAL]\ldots [PROCEDURE]\ldots [STATEMENTS]\ldots}\\
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[GLOBAL] Global variable declarations as defined in \fullref{def:global}
	\item[PROCEDURE] Procedures as defined in \fullref{def:procedure}
	\item[STATEMENTS] Statements as defined in \fullref{def:statements}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Example}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
global int number = 5;

procedure eq(int num1, int num2, bool out) {
	if ((num1 == num2)) {
		out = true;
	} else {
		out = false;
	}
}

int otherNumber = 6;
bool out;
eq(number, otherNumber, out);
print(out);
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
All files must follow the program syntax, and may only contain a single program.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
A program is a collection of code which can be used to create an executable set of instructions. It is the root node of the Abstract Syntax Tree.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
Any program is generally built up as follows:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Thread control code}
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item \textbf{Thread Control Loop} \\ All extra threads loop here, waiting to accept fork calls.
		\item \textbf{PreCall forked procedures} \\ Once a sprockell accepts a fork call, it reads the AR from global memory, and starts execution.
		\item \textbf{PostCall forked procedures} \\ Once an auxilary sprockell finishes the procedure, this code handles cleanup.
	\end{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{Procedures \ref{def:procedure}}
	\item \textbf{Global declarations \ref{def:global}}
	\item \textbf{Main code}
	
	\item \textbf{Post-program code} \\ Stops auxilary threads.
\end{compactitem}


\subsection{Global}
\label{def:global}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{global <TYPE> <ID> [= <EXPRESSION>] ;}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[TYPE] A type as defined in \fullref{def:types}
	\item[ID] A string as defined by \fullref{def:variable}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
global bool flag = true;
global int number;
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Used to declare global variables and an optional assignment.  The type of the expression must match the type of the global variable.

All global variables MUST be defined at the top of the program, even before procedures.

The id of a global variable is unique in the whole program. No other variable of procedure may use the same id. They can therefore not be shadowed.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
The global variable declaration reserves a space in shared memory and writes a value to it. All global variables are initialized to the default value (see \fullref{def:integer} and \fullref{def:boolean}) if no value is explicitly assigned.

Global variables are reachable from anywhere below its declaration in the code, in any thread. Beware, however, that the variable can be written to from any thread as well, and using the shared memory is significantly slower than using the local memory.

Globals that are passed as arguments to a procedure have their own intricacies, see \ref{def:call-by-refence} for more information.

\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
All globals are saved in global memory. Writes and reads to globals are done atomically, but assignments are not. This avoids data races, but to ensure atomicity on the whole assignment, one must implement his own mutual exclusion.


\subsection{Procedure}
\label{def:procedure}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{procedure <ID> ( [<TYPE> <VAR>] [, <TYPE> <VAR>]\ldots ) <STATEMENT>...}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[ID] A string as defined in \fullref{def:variable}
	\item[TYPE] A type as defined in \fullref{def:types}
	\item[VAR] A variable as defined in \fullref{def:variable}
	\item[STATEMENT] A statement as defined in \fullref{def:statements}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
procedure empty() print(0);
procedure other(int num, bool flip) {
	while ((num > 0)) {
		num = --num;
		flip = !flip;
	}
	print(num, flip);
}
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Used to declare a procedure. Because call-by-reference (see \fullref{def:call-by-reference}) is used, a variable passed as an argument can be used to write resulting values. One could also use the global variables (see \fullref{def:global}), as they are accessible from everywhere.

The id of a procedure is unique in the whole program. No other variable of procedure may use the same id.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
A procedure is section of code that can be executed from anywhere, using a call or fork statement (see \fullref{def:call} and \fullref{def:fork}) and passing the appropriate number of arguments to it.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
Procedure code has the following structure:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{PostCall code} \\ Copies all arguments into the local data area for use. 
	\item \textbf{Procedure's statements}
	\item \textbf{PreReturn code} \\ The final result of all arguments is read, and if they are global or local variables, saved to the appropriate location.
\end{compactitem}


\section{Statements}
\label{def:statements}


\subsection{Declaration}
\label{def:declaration}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{<TYPE> <ID> [= <EXPRESSION>] ;}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[TYPE] A type as defined in \fullref{def:types}
	\item[ID] A string as defined in \fullref{def:variable}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
int number = (1+1);
bool flag;
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Used to declare local variables and an optional assignment. The type of the expression must match the type of the variable.

The id of a variable is unique in the scope it is defined in. No other variable in that scope may use the same id.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
The variable declaration writes the value of the variable to the Local Data Area of where it was (most recently) defined. All variables are initialized to the default value (see \fullref{def:integer} and \fullref{def:boolean}) if no value is explicitly assigned.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn
A declaration evaluates the expression behind it before assigning it to the variable. The variable's value is saved in the appropriate Local Data Area, by following the scopes upward until the right scope is reached, after which it is saved with an offset.

\subsection{If}
\label{def:if}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{if ( <EXPRESSION> ) <STATEMENT> [else <STATEMENT>]}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
	\item[STATEMENT] A statement as defined in \fullref{def:statements}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
if (flag) {
	// do something
}
if (flag) print(flag); else {
	// do something
}
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Execute a section of code based on an expression. The type of this expression must be a boolean.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
If the expression evaluates to \emph{true}, execute the first statement. If it evaluates to \emph{false}, execute the code after the first statement, which can be either the second statement or the code that comes after the if statement.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{While}
\label{def:while}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{while ( <EXPRESSION> ) <STATEMENT>}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
	\item[STATEMENT] A statement as defined in \fullref{def:statements}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
while (flag) {
	// do something
}
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Execute a section of code while the expression is \emph{true}. The type of this expression must be a boolean.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
If the expression evaluates to \emph{true}, execute the statement. Repeat this for as long as the expression keeps evaluating to \emph{true}.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{Fork}
\label{def:fork}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{fork <ID> ( [<EXPRESSION> [, <EXPRESSION>]\ldots] ) ;}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[ID] A string as defined by \fullref{def:variable}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined by \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
fork proc0();
fork proc1(flag);
fork proc2(5, flag = true);
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Run a procedure, which must have been declared somewhere, on a separate thread. The expression types must match the types defined during the procedure declaration (see \fullref{def:procedure}).
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
Writes the argument to shared memory and tells the thread pool to start parallel execution of the procedure.

Beware, if more procedures are given to the thread pool than there are threads, fork may have to wait for a thread to finish its work before continuing execution. In the case where only a single thread exists, this will cause the code to enter an infinite loop.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{Join}
\label{def:join}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{join ;}
\paragraph{Example}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
join;
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Ensures all thread have are done before continuing. May only be called in the main thread.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
Blocks execution of the main thread until all other threads have finished their work.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{Call}
\label{def:call}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{<ID> ( [<EXPRESSION> [, <EXPRESSION>]\ldots] ) ;}
\begin{mycompactdesc}

	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined by \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
proc0();
proc1(flag);
proc2(5, flag = true);
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Execute the called procedure, which must have been declared somewhere. The expressions must have the same types as the procedure as defined in its declaration (see \fullref{def:procedure})
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
Go to the procedure code and execute the procedure with the expressions, then return to the call.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{Expression}
\label{def:expression_statement}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{<EXPRESSION> ;}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
a = (5 + (--6));
true;
-++++++++++a;
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Allows expressions to be executed as statements, mostly for the purpose of enabling an assignment (see \fullref{def:assignment}) as a statement, since an assignment is an expression.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
Execute the expression, this generally has no effects, except for an assignment.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{Block}
\label{def:block}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{\{ [STATEMENT]\ldots \}}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[STATEMENT] A statement as defined in \fullref{def:statements}
\end{mycompactdesc}

	{
		i = ++i;
		{
			int i = 5;
		}
		print((i == 1));
	}
	print((i == 1));
}
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
A block is a single statement that contains zero or more statements. It is mostly used within procedures and statements to executes more than one statement.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
A block opens a new scope, then executes the code within. When exiting a block, the scope is closed.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\subsection{Print}
\label{def:print}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{print ( <EXPRESSION> [, <EXPRESSION>]\ldots ) ;}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Examples}

print(true, 5, 1983);
print(a = ++a, ((11 - 2) * a));
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Prints values of evaluated expressions to the console.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
Evaluates the expressions and prints the values as they appear in memory, meaning a boolean is represented as either a zero (\emph{false}) or a one (\emph{true}).
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn


\section{Expressions}
\label{def:expressions}


\subsection{Parentheses}
\label{def:parentheses}
\subsubsection*{Syntax}
\texttt{( <EXPRESSION> )}
\begin{mycompactdesc}
	\item[EXPRESSION] An expression as defined in \fullref{def:expressions}
\end{mycompactdesc}
\paragraph{Example}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{text}
a = -(-(----a); // the same as: a = (-1) * (-1) * (a - 2);
\end{minted}
\subsubsection*{Usage}
Parentheses are used to enforce which operator is used (see the example above). It can also be used to enforce the order in which an expression is evaluated, but since this already explicitly happens (see \fullref{def:operation}) it should not be necessary to use a parentheses expression for it.
\subsubsection*{Semantics}
Everything between the parentheses is evaluated and the value is returned as the result of this expression.
\subsubsection*{Code Generation}
%TODO Martijn

\subsection{Error Handling}
\label{def:error_handling}
The SHL compiler does not support proper exception handling, but does throw errors of varying usefulness. During the tokenising phase, the only error thrown is an illegal character error.

During the parsing phase, the only error which might be thrown is a non-exhaustive pattern error, indicating the grammar cannot parse the token list.

The checker phase thrown different kinds of errors, all related to context constraints, they generally indicate the function which throws the error as well as printing some of the responsible data.

The code generation and runtime phases thrown the following kinds of errors:
%TODO Martijn, beschrijf kort de error handling van de codegen

%------------------------------------------------
\chapter{Description of the Software}
\label{description_of_the_software}
The compiler consists of a number of haskell files, and some additional files. This chapter will go over the functions of each of those files.

\section{ASTBuilder.hs}
The purpose of the ASTBuilder is to build an Abstract Syntax Tree using a parsetree. The ASTBuilder also contains the functions to convert an AST to a RoseTree with or without debug information.

\section{BasicFunctions.hs}
Part of the Sprockell. Any changes in the Sprockell code have been annotated with \texttt{PP26:\ldots}.

\section{Checker.hs}
The checker checks an AST and adds information about scopes to it. It works in two passes, first collecting information about global variables and procedures, then checking for all context constraints.

\section{CodeGen.hs}
CodeGen takes a checked AST and generates a set of SprIL instructions. %TODO Martijn, is this enough, do you wish to elaborate?

Grammar contains the grammar used in the compiler.

\section{HardwareTypes.hs}
Part of the Sprockell. Any changes in the Sprockell code have been annotated with \texttt{PP26:\ldots}.

\section{Main.hs}
Main file, used for compilation and execution of SHL programs. Read the README.md for information on how to use it.

\section{README.md}
Constains some information about the project in general (eg. the Trello board) and instructions on how to use the compiler.

\section{Implemented Tests}
\label{implemented_tests}
Following is a list of all the test files that have been used to test the compiler, and a short description of their purpose.
\begin{mycompactdesc}
    \item[cyclic\_{}recursion] Tests for correct cyclic recursion
    \item[deep\_{}expression] Tests for correct evaluation of nested expressions
    \item[fib] Tests for correct evaluation of a Fibonacci procedure 
    \item[if] Tests a correct simple if statement
    \item[ifelse] Tests a correct simple if-else statement
    \item[infinite\_{}busy\_{}loop] Tests behaviour in an empty infinite loop
    \item[infinite\_{}loop] Tests behaviour in an infinite loop with some operation in it. Also tests integer overflows, which are not detected.
    \item[nested\_{}procedures] Tests for correct evaluation of nested procedures
    \item[recursion] Tests for correct recursion
    \item[while] Tests a simple correct while statement
    \item[call\_{}by\_{}reference] Tests for correct multi-threaded call-by-reference
    \item[blocks] Tests for correct handling of scopes
    \item[simple\_{}proc] Tests a simple correct procedure
	\item[banking] Tests a concurrent banking application
    \item[peterson] Tests for correct evaluation of Peterson's algorithm
    \item[simple\_{}concurrency] Tests a simple correct concurrent program
    \item[multiple\_{}globals] Tests behaviour of concurrent printing of global variables
    \item[join\_{}test] Tests whether join behaviour is correct
\end{mycompactdesc}


\section{Test Plan}
The testing has been roughly divided into three cases: syntax, context constraints and semantics. For the first two phases most of the testing of correct code occurs during the semantic testing and as informal testing during the building of those parts of the compiler. Some test files have been made to more formally test the incorrect code.

The shape of the parse tree and Abstract Syntax Tree have been extensively observed and checked during the building of the checking part of the compiler. This has mostly been done by slightly tweaking a program a multitude of times, to produce all intended shapes of the tree and attempting to produce unintended shapes, and building the trees. This part of the testing, as well as the previous part, have not been documented very well, and might therefore appear somewhat lacking compared to the semantic testing.

The semantics, or run-time, testing has been given the most time and effort, and checks for correctness of code generation and intended behaviour. Since very little run-time error are thrown (see \fullref{def:error_handling}), there are only a few tests of incorrect code, or code producing unintended effects.


\section{How To Run a Test}
\label{how_to_run_a_test}
To run a test, simply follow the \texttt{README.md}, using the following path: \texttt{test/<fileName>}, where \texttt{fileName} is one of the tests described above. Remember that for a concurrent program, which is any program that uses at least one fork statement, multiple Sprockells have to be used.

\section{Martijn}
%TODO somewhere at the end by Martijn
\section{Tim}
I personally am quite satisfied with the language and compiler we built. It's a lot better than last year's, and think it should be quite usable this time. We decided to focus mostly on a simple set of things we wanted, and I believe we mostly delivered on those things. I know call-by-reference is somewhat iffy, it uses an internal value and only writes it back to the references variable at the end of the procedure, but that should be fine for sequential programs. For parallel programs, just stick with Peterson's algorithm if you need something to be mutually exclusive, which isn't just a single write.

I quite like the Programming Paradigms module, with the exception of concurrent programming. I find building a compiler quite interesting, and I really like function programming (we actually scored a 10 for the project), yet somehow concurrent programming just isn't really my thing. It just doesn't really capture my attention, and that shows in the results. The first test I just left early because it wasn't going to work out anyway, and I had to miss the second one because I got ill the day before, so I'm currently trying to get a third attempt.

I do have to say the workload of this module is still quite high, but mostly doable. It mostly just requires some good time management and work ethics, in which I occasionally lack a bit. The way the module is structured, mostly the CC exercises, means that occasionally you have to wait quite a bit for a student assistant to be available, but I found this much less of an issue than last year.

I cannot comment on the lectures this year, as I didn't go to most of them, seeing as I had been there last year. In retrospect it would have been a good idea to go to the CP lectures, but I can't do much about that now.

I finish this up, I enjoyed this module, with the exception of CP. There were a few problems along the way, but they quickly dealt with and weren't really an issue for me in the end. Every module can improve in some ways, but I would have to say I'm quite content with this one.
